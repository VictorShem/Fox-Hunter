A knowledge base for Silver Fox countermeasures.

Given the rapidly evolving and highly sophisticated countermeasures employed by the Silver Fox malware, I have established a knowledge base for Silver Fox countermeasures to facilitate understanding, searching, and learning (please do not use for illegal purposes). This knowledge base will be continuously updated as it evolves. It is intended for advanced red teams, malware analysts, and incident responders. I believe those who need this knowledge base understand its purpose, so I will not provide detailed annotations for the techniques included. Instead, I will only provide links for reference.
